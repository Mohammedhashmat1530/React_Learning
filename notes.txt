JSX:
JSX stands for JavaScript XML. JSX allows us to write HTML elements with JavaScript code


const jsxElement = <h1>I am a JSX element</h1>
const welcome = <h1>Welcome to 30 Days of React Challenge</h1>
const data = <small>Oct 2, 2020</small>
The above strange looking code seems like JavaScript and it seems like , but it is not JavaScript and it seems like HTML but not completely an HTML element. It is a mix of JavaScript and an HTML elements. JSX can allow us to use HTML in JavaScript. The HTML element in the JSX above is h1 and small.

Injecting data to a JSX Element:
const title = 'Getting Started React'
const header = (
  <header>
    <div className='header-wrapper'>
      <h2>{title}</h2>
    </div>
  </header>
)

React Boilerplate:
Let's see the React boilerplate, which has been created by create-react-app. Whenever you create a new project, you run create-react-app and name of the project.

In the following React boilerplate, there are three folders: node_modules, public and src. In addition, there are .gitignore, README.md, package.json and yarn.lock. Some of you, instead of yarn.lock, you may have package-lock.json.

It is good to know these folders and files.

node_modules - stores all the necessary node packages of the React applications.

Public

index.html - the only HTML file we have in the entire application

favicon.ico - an icon file

manifest.json - is used to make the application a progressive web app

other images - open graph images(open graph images are images which are visible when a link share on social media)

robots.txt - information, if the website allows web scraping

src

App.css, index.css - are different CSS files
index.js - a file which allows to connect all the components with index.html
App.js - A file where we usually import most of the presentational components
serviceWorker.js: is used to add progressive web app features
setupTests.js - to write testing cases
package.json- List of packages the applications uses

.gitignore - React boilerplate comes with git initiated, and the .gitingore allows files and folders not to be pushed to GitHub

README.md - Markdown file to write documentation

yarn.lock or package-lock.json - a means to lock the version of the package
