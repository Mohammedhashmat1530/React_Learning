JSX:
JSX stands for JavaScript XML. JSX allows us to write HTML elements with JavaScript code


const jsxElement = <h1>I am a JSX element</h1>
const welcome = <h1>Welcome to 30 Days of React Challenge</h1>
const data = <small>Oct 2, 2020</small>
The above strange looking code seems like JavaScript and it seems like , but it is not JavaScript and it seems like HTML but not completely an HTML element. It is a mix of JavaScript and an HTML elements. JSX can allow us to use HTML in JavaScript. The HTML element in the JSX above is h1 and small.

Injecting data to a JSX Element:
const title = 'Getting Started React'
const header = (
  <header>
    <div className='header-wrapper'>
      <h2>{title}</h2>
    </div>
  </header>
)
